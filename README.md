# HLA-NoVR
The easiest to use and most flexible NoVR mod for Half-Life: Alyx!

This mod makes the entire game playable, with many VR interactions preserved in some form for a flat screen.
This fork removes the launcher requirement and fixes various issues like crashing on every death.

## Installation
download code and drop the contents of the "game" folder inside hl:a's "game" folder.
start the included play.bat file or run the game through your steam library.

## Launch Options
`-novr -vsync -console -vconsole -noversioninfo +vr_enable_fake_vr 1`
Optional:
`-w 1920 -h 1080` (replace with your screen's resolution)
